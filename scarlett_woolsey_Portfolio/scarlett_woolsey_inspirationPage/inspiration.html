    <h4>She is a figurative oil painter that creates surreal scenes involving multiple aspects of herself. 
        I really want to incorporate that level of storytelling into my own work someday.</h4>

        <img src="img/annie.png" alt="annie atkins prop designs">
    <h4>Atkins is a designer known for creating film props, most popularly for Wes Anderson.
        She often works with more traditional media like typewrites, quills, and handlettering,
        which is something I've been trying to integrate into my own designs.</h4>

        <br>
        <img src="img/lou.png" alt="lou benesch illustration">
    <h4>Benesch is a watercolorist that creates colorful folk illustrations. I adore her use of bold color palettes,
         as well as her creative compositions and surreal creatures. Everytime I see one of her pieces I want to paint
         something colorful or just plain weird.</h4>
