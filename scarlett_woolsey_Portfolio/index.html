        <h1> Scarlett Woolsey</h1>
        <br>
        <h4>Scarlett is a twenty-something emerging artist and designer based in San Francisco.
            Highly influenced by her homeschooled childhood spent reading and building tree forts
            with her peers, she values a sense of beauty and whimsy in her work. In addition to this,
            her work is largely influenced by her ongoing quest to figure out being a woman in today's 
            society, as well as what part she plays in the world.
            You can probably find her day dreaming on the train, lurking in a bookstore, dialing espresso
            in a little coffee trailer somewhere, or soaking up sun like a lizard.
